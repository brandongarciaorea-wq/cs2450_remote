Date: 8.29.25 - Git: What I learned today was how to make a remote and a local repo. It was good to learn how to do and use the terminal more. I also installed a virtual environment and started using vim.
Date: 9.5.25 - Today I decided to not use the virual environment and forced install for pip. This is better for my situation right now. I created the ideas.py file and I pushed it to the project repo. I also learned how to work with flask and make the websited using the html files. I then pushed the apps.py and the names.py files to my local repo and called it a day.
