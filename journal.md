Date: 8.29.25 - Git: What I learned today was how to make a remote and a local repo. It was good to learn how to do and use the terminal more. I also installed a virtual environment and started using vim.

Date: 9.5.25 - Today I decided to not use the virual environment and forced install for pip. This is better for my situation right now. I created the ideas.py file and I pushed it to the project repo. I also learned how to work with flask and make the websited using the html files. I then pushed the apps.py and the names.py files to my local repo and called it a day.

Date 9.11.25: This week we learned about user stories and their usefulness when it comes to planning. We each made 5 user stories as well as assigned a priotity number to them. This was useful to be able to see the idea of our website come to life more. 

Date 9.19.25: This week I learned about merging with git and how to deal with merge conflicts. We also talked about coding algorithms and how they are used by watching a youtube video. We also learned about diagrams and I decided to start reading the book the professor mentioned in the slides.

Date 9.26.25: This week I learned about presentations and some tips to make them better. We have to pitch our project to the professor next week with our presentation. I learned that text, size, color, shapes, and even context is all important when it comes to presenting. I also learned about Design Youtube and how the system works when a customer uploads their video to the cloud. 

Date 10.03.25: This week we presented our presentation about our website to the classroom. I also got to watch the other teams presentation as well. We got some good feedbak from the professor about our website and some ideas to maybe implement the website to the phone as well. I also learned about project management and how to add a kanaban board. Lastly I also played around with the code for our website and how to change the color on the site.

Date 10.08.25: This week we learned about what it is actually like working as a software engineer. The professor walked us through the typical workspace of the engineer. I also learned about pair programming and the benefits of it. I worked as the driver and as the navigator. When I was the driver we researched on how to make the flask be able to run on on a handheld device. As the navigator we figured out the code to be able to upload images via flask to the website. 

Date 10.17.25: This week in class we had lab time to work on our project. The most important thing I learned this week and that we talked about was ethics. We talked and learned about ethical problems in the software development world. We talked about the trolley problem, and we played a game that had to due with the trolley problem as well. I also watched a video about AI and its kinda scary decision to act on a human. Overall it brought unthought of things to my attention and I will keep them in mind in the future.

Date 10.24.25: This week in class we talked about the importance of unit testing. We then got to work with selenium and got to make our own unit tests for our project. I learned how to write unit test and got to make them for the login screen of our website. Another thing I learned this week at school was about classes and structs in C++. 

Date 10.31.25: This week in class we learned about refactoring code. I got to practice doing so on some example code. It helped me learn how to not add more features, but make them more readable/efficient. We also got lab time for working on our project. One last thing we learned about was User Experience and how to make it better. 

Date 11.7.25: This week we learned about Development Pipeline Automation. This is how to tests our code in git hub, we used our selenium tests we made to do this. We put it into our git hub actions so that it will run all our tests when we push to main. We also learned about other testing methods.
