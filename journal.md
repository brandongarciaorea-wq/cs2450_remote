Date: 8.29.25 - Git: What I learned today was how to make a remote and a local repo. It was good to learn how to do and use the terminal more. I also installed a virtual environment and started using vim.

Date: 9.5.25 - Today I decided to not use the virual environment and forced install for pip. This is better for my situation right now. I created the ideas.py file and I pushed it to the project repo. I also learned how to work with flask and make the websited using the html files. I then pushed the apps.py and the names.py files to my local repo and called it a day.

Date 9.11.25: This week we learned about user stories and their usefulness when it comes to planning. We each made 5 user stories as well as assigned a priotity number to them. This was useful to be able to see the idea of our website come to life more. 

Date 9.19.25: This week I learned about merging with git and how to deal with merge conflicts. We also talked about coding algorithms and how they are used by watching a youtube video. We also learned about diagrams and I decided to start reading the book the professor mentioned in the slides.
